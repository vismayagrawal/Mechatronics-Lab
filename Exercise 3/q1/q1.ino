/*
  Reading a serial ASCII-encoded string.

  This sketch demonstrates the Serial parseInt() function.
  It looks for an ASCII string of comma-separated values.
  It parses them into ints, and uses those to fade an RGB LED.

  Circuit: Common-Cathode RGB LED wired like so:
  - red anode: digital pin 3
  - green anode: digital pin 5
  - blue anode: digital pin 6
  - cathode: GND

const int buttonPin = 8;

void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(7, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
